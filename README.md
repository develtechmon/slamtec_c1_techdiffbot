This is good website that explain the details parameters of motor we used in this project. 
It shows critical parameters such as `CPR`, `PPR`. Please visit this page to understand the details of our motor

```

## Upload Arduino Code
And lastly, you will have to upload `ROSArduinoBridge.ino` code into your `Arduino Nano`. Please refer to this
userguide on how to `install` and `test` if Encoder and Motor is working. This code is already compiled together in this package.
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/ROS2/blob/main/UserGuide/ros2_control_arduino_setup.md
```

## Part 2 : Package Installation Inside RPI and PC

This is my components for this tutorial
* SD Card 64 GB
* Raspberry Pi Imager
* RPI 4 4GB
* HDMI and Keyboard
  
For, `RPI` i'm using the following image which is selected from RPI imager and flash the SD Card using this same tool
```
Ubuntu 64-bit
Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Desktop Version
```

Once done, please connect your `Flashed SD cards` to RPI 4B and follow the setup from there to connect to network and do necessary installation.

In next step, you're going to install ROS2 Humbles inside your `RPI` and `PC` and all  associated packages. Please refer to this documents on how to do this setup.
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/ROS2/blob/main/UserGuide/ros2_humble_installation_packages_guide.md
```

## Part 3 : Enable SSH and Disable Graphic Inside RPI

For most of time, you will need to work and connect with `SSH` to RPI and work only with console instead of graphic interface. 

### Enable `SSH`
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/ROS2/blob/main/UserGuide/ssh_installation.md
```

### Disable Graphic To Save `RAM`
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/ROS2/blob/main/UserGuide/ros2_disable_enable_rpi_graphic.md
```

## Part 4 : Install Slamtec C1 package in RPI and PC

To install this package, please refer to this userguide
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/ROS2/blob/main/UserGuide/ros2_slamtec_rplidar_installation.md
```

## Part 5 : Configure `STEAM Deck` Controller

Please refer to this userguide on how to setup our `Steam Deck` controller which will be used later to control the robot
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/ROS2/blob/main/UserGuide/Steam_Controller_Joystick.md
```

## Part 6 : Git Clone this package

Now let's start building and compiler our robot. Open new terminal in PC or SSH to RPI and please do the following:
```
https://github.com/develtechmon/slamtec_c1_techdiffbot.git
cd slamtec_c1_techdiffbot/
cd bumperbot_ws/

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
rosdep update && rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src -y
colcon buiild
```

## Launch Our Robot and SLAM !

## Simulation 
In your RPI, please go to  following command
```
cd ~/Desktop/My_Project/slamtec_c1_techdiffbot/bumperbot_ws
```

Run this command to launch our REAL robot in RPI
```
ros2 launch bumperbot_bringup real_robot.launch.py 
```

Once done, then we can run `SLAM` either from RPI or PC and set `use_sim_time:=True`
```
ros2 launch bumperbot_bringup slam.launch.py use_sim_time:=True
```

## Real Robot 
In your RPI, please go to  following command
```
cd ~/Desktop/My_Project/slamtec_c1_techdiffbot/bumperbot_ws
```

Run this command to launch our REAL robot in RPI
```
ros2 launch bumperbot_bringup real_robot.launch.py 
```

Once done, then we can run `SLAM` either from RPI or PC and set `use_sim_time:=False`
```
ros2 launch bumperbot_bringup slam.launch.py use_sim_time:=False
```

## Move and Control Your robot

You can use your `Steam Controller` Joystick or any other Joystick to control the robot. When you launch this script, 
it automatically recognize our `joystick`. 

However, if you don't have joystick, we can control the robot using keyboard. Please use this command as follow:
```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args --remap /cmd_vel:=/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped
```
